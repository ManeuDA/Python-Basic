#Comparison operators
# a == b: a is equal to b
# a != b: a is different than b
# a < b: a is smaller than b
# a <= b: a is smaller or equal to b
# a > b: a is bigger than b
# a >= b: a is bigger or equal to b

# Logical operators
# a and b: True if both a and b are True. False otherwise.
# a or b: True if either a or b or both are True. False if both are False.
# not a: True if a is False, False if a is True.

# Branching blocks
# if condition1:
	# if-block
# elif condition2:
	# elif-block
# else:
	# else-block




#Comparison - Boolean Values (true or false) : 0, <, >
print(10>1)             #Answer: True

#Equality operator : ==
print("cat" == "dog")       ##Answer: False

#Not equals operator : !=
print(1 !=1)                #Answer: False

#Logical Operators: and, or, not
    # and  - both must be true to be true
print("Yello" > "Cyan" and "Brown" > "Magenta")          #Answer: False
    # or  - one is true, then it is true
print(25 > 50 or 1 != 2)                     #Answer: True
    # not  - inverts the value of the expression that's in front of it
print(not 42 == "Answer")               #Answer: True

# Branching - the ability of a program to alter its execution sequence
# Branching with 'if' Statement : if block only execute when the condition evalutates to true; otherwise it's skipped
